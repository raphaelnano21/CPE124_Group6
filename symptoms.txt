Cellulitis manifests through various symptoms that can signal its presence. Individuals may experience fever accompanied by chills and sweating, along with an overarching sense of fatigue. The affected area typically becomes painful or tender to the touch, often showing signs of skin redness or inflammation that gradually expands as the infection progresses. This redness might evolve into a sore or rash, appearing suddenly and rapidly intensifying within the initial 24 hours. The skin might take on a tight, glossy, stretched appearance, accompanied by warmth in the infected region. Additionally, due to tissue swelling over joints, muscle aches and joint stiffness might arise, contributing to discomfort. Some individuals may also experience nausea and vomiting as part of the overall symptoms of cellulitis.


Impetigo, a contagious skin infection, presents several distinct symptoms. These include the appearance of red sores that quickly rupture, ooze, and form honey-colored crusts. These sores commonly occur around the mouth and nose but can surface anywhere on the body. They're often itchy and may spread rapidly, leading to more sores. Swollen lymph nodes in the affected area might also accompany these skin lesions. In some cases, a fever could accompany these symptoms, but it's not as common.

Athlete's foot, a fungal infection of the skin on the feet, typically showcases several noticeable symptoms. These include itching, stinging, or burning sensations, especially between the toes or on the soles of the feet. The affected skin might appear red, cracked, or scaly, with potential for peeling or flaking. In severe cases, blisters and ulcers could form, causing pain and discomfort. Additionally, some individuals might experience a raw skin sensation or a mild odor emanating from the infected area.


Nail fungus, medically known as onychomycosis, often manifests with distinctive symptoms. Initially, it might appear as a white or yellow spot under the tip of the nail. As the infection progresses, the nail can become discolored, thickened, and brittle. It might develop a crumbly texture or even detach from the nail bed, leading to pain and discomfort. In advanced cases, the infected nail might emit a foul odor, and there could be slight swelling around the nail area. If left untreated, the infection can spread to other nails, causing further discoloration and deformities.


Ringworm, despite its name, is not caused by a worm but by a fungus that affects the skin. The symptoms of ringworm include a red or silver rash that appears in a circular or ring-shaped pattern, hence the name. This rash might be itchy, scaly, or raised, and it often has a defined border. It can occur on various parts of the body, such as the scalp, feet (athlete's foot), groin area (jock itch), or other skin areas. In some cases, multiple rings might develop, and the affected skin might show signs of inflammation. Additionally, hair loss might occur in areas affected by ringworm of the scalp.

Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin condition caused by hookworm larvae that typically infest tropical and subtropical areas. The primary symptom is the appearance of an itchy, winding, raised rash on the skin, resembling tracks or serpentine lines. These lines are where the larvae have migrated under the skin, and they can be red, raised, and intensely itchy. The rash may progress, changing its appearance as the larvae continue to move beneath the skin, causing discomfort and irritation. Other symptoms might include a burning sensation, swelling, or the formation of blisters along the tracks of the larvae.

Chickenpox, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, typically starts with symptoms similar to a mild flu, followed by the characteristic rash. Initially, individuals might experience a fever, headache, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Within a day or two, a red, itchy rash appears, starting on the face, chest, and back before spreading to other parts of the body. The rash develops into small, fluid-filled blisters that eventually crust over and scab. These blisters can be at different stages of healing simultaneously. Alongside the rash, individuals might also experience sore throat, cough, abdominal pain, and in some cases, the blisters can cause mild to moderate itching and discomfort.

Shingles, caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox), typically presents as a painful, blistering rash. Prior to the rash's appearance, individuals might experience tingling, itching, or burning sensations in a specific area of the skin. This is often followed by a red, painful rash that forms small, fluid-filled blisters, commonly occurring in a band or stripe on one side of the body or face. The rash can be accompanied by fever, headache, fatigue, and sensitivity to light. The blisters typically crust over within a week to ten days and gradually heal, but some individuals might experience persistent pain, known as postherpetic neuralgia, in the affected area for months or even years after the rash has healed.
